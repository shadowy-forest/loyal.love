#### ➡️   yeap, i'm intentionally not using any frontend framework here, it's all raw html and css for fun and profit and nostalgy and subversion (i am a backend engineer who has hated javascript since those days when javascript wasn't the javascript we have now, however, i'm still pretty skilled if i need to wate into those waters - so before you give some hate, dunno, just check some of my repos or go for a walk - love and peace, always <3)
