      in 1936, alan turing introduced the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine" target="_blank">universal turing machine</a>
      , a theoretical model of computation that could simulate any other turing machine.
      <br />
      in 1985, david deutsch extended this concept to quantum mechanics by proposing the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Turing_machine" target="_blank">quantum turing machine</a>,
      <br />
      a theoretical model capable of efficiently simulating quantum systems and laying the foundation for quantum
      computation.
      <br />
      remarkably, in 1994, peter shor demonstrated that
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm" target="_blank">
        quantum computers could efficiently factor large numbers</a
      >,
      <br />
      proving their superiority over classical computers and its implications for

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_computing_and_communication" target="_blank">
        lot of progress has happened</a
      >
      in the field in the last decades,
      <br />
      however, one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing continues to be
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence" target="_blank">decoherence</a>,
      <br />
      (i.e., when quantum information is lost due to interactions with the environment).
      <br />
      unlike classical systems, where errors can often be mitigated through cooling,
      <br />
      quantum systems require error correction mechanisms due to their continuous nature.

      <br />
      <br />

      i explored various aspects of
      <a href="https://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/books/qi.pdf" target="_blank">
        quantum computing back during my phd</a
      >, but as a <a href="https://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch" target="_blank">string theorist</a>,
      <br />
      i was particularly drawn to the theoretical yet elegant approach of quantum
      <a href="https://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/books/tqfts.pdf" target="_blank">topological</a>
      computing,
      <br />
      which is
      <i>inherently fault-tolerant (i.e., resistant to decoherence)</i>. let's talk about it.

      <br />
      <br />

      starting from the basics, a quantum computer is a computational device that harnesses the principles of quantum
      mechanics
      <br />
      (such as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition" target="_blank">superposition</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" target="_blank">entanglement</a>, and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Bayesianism" target="_blank">quantum interference</a>) to process
      information in ways that classical computers cannot.
      <br />
      it does this by leveraging a primitive called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit" target="_blank">qubit</a>
      , a normalized linear superposition of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormality" target="_blank">orthonormal states</a>
      |0&gt; and |1&gt;,
      <br />
      which are members of the 2D complex vector space called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space" target="_blank">hilbert space</a>:

      <div class="image-row">
        <img src="../imgs/qc_qubits1.webp" class="image-15" />
        <img src="../imgs/qc_qubits4.png" class="image-25" />
        <img src="../imgs/qc_qubits2.webp" class="image-20" />
      </div>

      <br />
      <br />

      in a 3D space, particles can be classified as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson" target="_blank">bosons</a>
      (with integer spin quantum numbers) or
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion" target="_blank">fermions</a>
      (with half-integer spin quantum numbers).
      <br />
      when one particle in a 3D space is moved around another and returned to its original position,
      <br />
      this path is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism" target="_blank">topologically equivalent</a>
      to not moving the particle at all (because the path can be deformed into an arbitrarily small loop).
      <br />
      this constraint makes the statistics involved in exchanging fermions and bosons very simple, producing a phase
      change of π or 2π only.

      <br />
      <br />

      frank wilczek introduced the term
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon" target="_blank">anyon</a>
      in 1982, describing them as composites of charged particles in (2+1)-dimensional models.
      <br />
      the statistical properties of these quasiparticles are that they interpolate continuously between bosons and
      fermions,
      <br />
      i.e., they acquire arbitrary
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_factor" target="_blank">phase factors</a>
      when exchanged (and this phenomenon has been observed in the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_quantum_Hall_effect" target="_blank">
        fractional quantum hall effect</a
      >).

      <br />
      <br />

      in 2003, alexei kitaev published a radical idea in his
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9707021" target="_blank">
        "fault-tolerant quantum computation by anyons"</a
      >,
      <br />
      proposing that a 2D quantum system hosting
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-abelian_group" target="_blank">non-abelian</a>
      (i.e., non-commutative) anyonic excitations could function as a quantum computer.
      <br />
      in this model, computations are performed by braiding these anyons, inducing
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_transformation" target="_blank">unitary transformations</a>
      in the system's quantum state.

      <br />
      <br />

      one of the simplest models of non-abelian anyon is the
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3275" target="_blank">fibonacci anyon</a>,
      <br />
      which appears on the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern%E2%80%93Simons_theory" target="_blank">
        SU(2) witten–chern–simons topological quantum field theory</a
      >
      (yeap, that
      <a href="https://docs.urani.trade/mev-agents/operator-onboarding/solving-cryptomarkets/thank-you-jim">simons</a>).

      <br />
      <br />

      <div class="center-stuff">
        <img src="../imgs/qc_qtf1.webp" class="image-35" />
      </div>

      <br />
      <br />

      the fibonacci model contains two particle types:

      <br />
      <br />

      i) the vacuum (with 'charge' 0), denoted by 1, and
      <br />
      ii) the non-trivial anyon (with 'charge' 1) here denoted by 𝜏

      <br />
      <br />

      their fusion rules can be written as:

      <br />
      <br />

      <div class="center-stuff">
        1 ⊗ 𝜏 = 𝜏 (fusion with vacuum does nothing)
        <br />
        𝜏 ⊗ 1 = 𝜏 (fusion with vacuum does nothing)
        <br />
        𝜏 ⊗ 𝜏 = 1 ⊕ 𝜏 (creation of another anyon)
        <br />
        <br />
        (⊗ denotes the fusion of two particles and ⊕ denotes multiple possible outcomes)
      </div>
      <br />

      <div class="image-row">
        <img src="../imgs/qc_braids.webp" class="image-40" />
        <img src="../imgs/qc_braids_2.webp" class="image-40" />
        <img src="../imgs/qc_qubits3.webp" class="image-40" />
      </div>

      this means that when two fibonacci anyons interact, they can either fuse into vacuum (annihilating each other) or
      another fibonacci anyon.
      <br />
      if the braid was not present, then the two pairs would individually fuse to vacuum with 100% probability.
      <br />
      however, by performing the braiding and then fusing the particles, there is a non-zero probability that the fusion
      could give 1 instead of 0.
      <br />
      the net 'charge' of the whole system is still 0, though, so if the remaining two particles are fused, they must
      give the vacuum.
      <br />
      the outcome of the fusion of one of the pairs of anyons determines the fusion outcome of the other pair.
      <br />
      thus, their non-abelian nature ensures that exchanging them implements unitary transformations, forming the basis
      of topological quantum computation:

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <div class="center-stuff">
        1. create qubits from non-abelian anyons
        <br />
        2. move the anyons around — 'braiding' them to perform a computation
        <br />
        3. measure the state of the anyons by fusion
      </div>

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      for fibonacci anyons, the number of possible fusion outcomes (the dimension of the hilbert space)
      <br />
      grows according to the fibonacci sequence as more anyons are added.
      <br />
      this gives fibonacci anyons a quantum dimension of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio" target="_blank">golden ratio</a>.

      <br />
      <br />

      <div class="center-stuff">
        <img src="../imgs/fib.webp" class="image-25" />
      </div>

      <br />
      <br />

      in summary, fibonacci anyons naturally correct errors due to their topological properties:
      <br />
      a topologically ordered state with non-local quantum entanglement (i.e., small perturbations do not disrupt the
      system).
      <br />
      plus, the robustness of these systems allows for long-lasting quantum information storage.

      sonnet XVII, by pablo neruda <br />

      i do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,
      <br />
      or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off.
      <br />
      i love you as certain dark things are to be loved,
      <br />
      in secret, between the shadow and the soul.
      <br />
      <br />
      i love you as the plant that never blooms
      <br />
      but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers;
      <br />
      thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,
      <br />
      risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.
      <br />
      <br />
      i love you without knowing how, or when, or from where.
      <br />
      i love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride;
      <br />
      so i love you because i know no other way than this:
      <br />
      <br />
      where i does not exist, nor you,
      <br />
      so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,
      <br />
      so close that your eyes close as i fall asleep.

      soneto da fidelidade, by vinicius de moraes
      <br />
      <br />
      de tudo, ao meu amor serei atento
      <br />
      antes, e com tal zelo, e sempre, e tanto
      <br />
      que mesmo em face do maior encanto
      <br />
      dele se encante mais meu pensamento.
      <br />
      <br />
      quero vive-lo em cada vao momento
      <br />
      e em seu louvor hei de espalhar meu canto
      <br />
      e rir meu riso e derramar meu pranto
      <br />
      ao seu pesar ou seu contentamento.
      <br />
      <br />
      e assim, quando mais tarde me procure
      <br />
      quem sabe a morte, angustia de quem vive
      <br />
      quem sabe a solidao, fim de quem ama
      <br />
      eu possa me dizer do amor (que tive):
      <br />
      que nao seja imortal, posto que e chama
      <br />
      mas que seja infinito enquanto dure.
      <br />
