      🦋 we believe everything good is downstream of growth.<br />
      🦋 we believe not growing is stagnation, which leads to zero-sum thinking, internal fighting, degradation,
      collapse, and ultimately death. there are only three sources of growth: population growth, natural resource
      utilization, and technology.<br />
      🦋 developed societies are depopulating all over the world, across cultures – the total human population may
      already be shrinking.<br />

      🦋 in fact, technology – new knowledge, new tools, what the greeks called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techne" target="_blank">techne</a> – has always been the main source of

      utilization possible.<br />
      🦋 we believe technology is a lever on the world – the way to make more with less.<br />
      🦋 economists measure technological progress as productivity growth: how much more we can produce each year with
      fewer inputs, fewer raw materials.<br />
      🦋 productivity growth, powered by technology, is the main driver of economic growth, wage growth, and the
      creation of new industries and new jobs, as people and capital are continuously freed to do more important,
      valuable things than in the past.<br />
      🦋 productivity growth causes prices to fall, supply to rise, and demand to expand, improving the material well
      being of the entire population.<br />

    <h1 class="post-text" style="font-size: 1.8em"> IV. MARKETS </h1>
    <h5 class="post-text" style="text-align: left">
      🌈 we believe <a href="https://github.com/autistic-symposium/mev-toolkit" target="_blank">free markets</a> are the
      most effective way to organize a technological economy. willing buyer meets willing seller, a price is struck,
      both sides benefit from the exchange or it doesn't happen. <br />
      🌈 profits are the incentive for producing supply that fulfills demand. prices encode information about supply and
      demand. markets cause entrepreneurs to seek out high prices as a signal of opportunity to create new wealth by
      driving those prices down.<br />
      🌈 we believe the market economy is a discovery machine, a form of intelligence – an exploratory, evolutionary,
      adaptive system.<br />
      🌈 we believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek" target="_blank">hayek</a>'s knowledge
      problem overwhelms any centralized economic system. all actual information is on the edges, in the hands of the
      people closest to the buyer. the center, abstracted away from both the buyer and the seller, knows nothing.<br />
      🌈 centralized planning is doomed to fail, the system of production and consumption is too complex.<br />
      🌈 decentralization harnesses complexity for the benefit of everyone; centralization will starve you to death.<br />
      🌈 we believe in market discipline. the market naturally disciplines – the seller either learns and changes when
      the buyer fails to show, or exits the market. when market discipline is absent, there is no limit to how crazy
      things can get.<br />
      🌈 the motto of every monopoly and cartel, every centralized institution not subject to market discipline: "<i
        >we don't care, because we don't have to</i
      >". markets prevent monopolies and cartels.<br />
      🌈 we believe markets lift people out of poverty – in fact, markets are by far the most effective way to lift vast
      numbers of people out of poverty, and always have been. even in totalitarian regimes, an incremental lifting of
      the repressive boot off the throat of the people and their ability to produce and trade leads to rapidly rising
      incomes and standards of living. lift the boot a little more, even better. take the boot off entirely, who knows
      how rich everyone can get.<br />
      🌈 we believe markets are an inherently individualistic way to achieve superior collective outcomes.<br />
      🌈 we believe markets do not require people to be perfect, or even well intentioned – which is good, because, have
      you met people? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith" target="_blank">adam smith</a>: "<i
        >it is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from
        their regard to their own self-interest. we address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and
        never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages</i
      >".<br />
      🌈 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Friedman" target="_blank">david friedman</a> points out that
      people only do things for other people for three reasons –
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpnqxNAN44&list=PL_euFlqwkXnaCDxhOFiBdZeBdsBrtr8ZQ" target="_blank"
        >love</a
      >, money, or force. love doesn't scale, so the economy can only run on money or force. the force experiment has
      been run and found wanting. let's stick with money.<br />
      🌈 we believe the ultimate moral defense of markets is that they divert people who otherwise would raise armies
      and start religions into peacefully productive pursuits.<br />
      🌈 we believe <a href="https://github.com/autistic-symposium/cyph3rs-vue-js" target="_blank">markets</a>, to quote
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Stern,_Baron_Stern_of_Brentford" target="_blank">nicholas stern</a
      >, are how we take care of people we don't know.<br />
      🌈 we believe markets are the way to generate societal wealth for everything else we want to pay for, including
      basic research, social welfare programs, and national defense.<br />
      🌈 we believe there is no conflict between capitalist profits and a social welfare system that protects the
      vulnerable. in fact, they are aligned – the production of markets creates the economic wealth that pays for
      everything else we want as a society.<br />
      🌈 we believe central economic planning elevates the worst of us and drags everyone down; markets exploit the best
      of us to benefit all of us.<br />
      🌈 we believe central planning is a doom loop; markets are an upward spiral. the economist william nordhaus has
      shown that creators of technology are only able to capture about 2% of the economic value created by that
      technology. the other 98% flows through to society in the form of what economists call social surplus.
      technological innovation in a market system is inherently philanthropic, by a 50:1 ratio. who gets more value from
      a new technology, the single company that makes it, or the millions or billions of people who use it to improve
      their lives? QED.<br />
      🌈 we believe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo" target="_blank">david ricardo</a>'s concept
      of comparative advantage – as distinct from competitive advantage, comparative advantage holds that even someone
      who is best in the world at doing everything will buy most things from other people, due to opportunity cost.
      comparative advantage in the context of a properly free market guarantees high employment regardless of the level
      of technology.<br />
      🌈 we believe a market sets wages as a function of the marginal productivity of the worker. therefore technology –
      which raises productivity – drives wages up, not down. this is perhaps the most counterintuitive idea in all of
      economics, but it's true, and we have 300 years of history that prove it.<br />
      🌈 we believe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman" target="_blank">milton friedman</a>'s
      observation that
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiM9amrGVio" target="_blank">human wants and needs are infinite</a
      >.<br />
      🌈 we believe markets also increase societal well being by generating work in which people can
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wkm3XnQ430" target="_blank">productively engage</a>.<br />
      🌈 we believe a universal basic income would turn people into zoo animals to be farmed by the state. man was not
      meant to be farmed; man was meant to be useful, to be productive, to be proud.<br />
      🌈 we believe technological change, far from reducing the need for human work, increases it, by broadening the
      scope of what humans can productively do.<br />
      🌈 we believe that since human wants and needs are infinite, economic demand is infinite, and job growth can
      continue forever.<br />
      🌈 we believe markets are generative, not exploitative;
      <a href="https://www.urani.trade/blog/almost_summer" target="_blank">positive sum</a>, not zero sum.<br />
      🌈 participants in markets build on one another's work and output.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_P._Carse" target="_blank">james carse</a> describes
      <a href="http://amazon.com/Finite-Infinite-Games-James-Carse/dp/1476731713" target="_blank"
        >finite games and infinite games</a
      >
      – finite games have an end, when one person wins and another person loses; infinite games never end, as players
      collaborate to discover what's possible in the game.

    <h1 class="post-text" style="font-size: 1.8em"> V. THE TECHNO-CAPITAL MACHINE </h1>
    <h5 class="post-text" style="text-align: left">
      💎 combine technology and markets and you get what
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Land" target="_blank">nick land</a> has termed the techno-capital
      machine, the engine of perpetual material creation, growth, and abundance.<br />
      💎 we believe the techno-capital machine of markets and innovation never ends, but instead spirals continuously
      upward.<br />
      💎 comparative advantage increases specialization and trade. prices fall, freeing up purchasing power, creating
      demand. falling prices benefit everyone who buys goods and services, which is to say everyone.<br />
      💎 human wants and needs are endless, and entrepreneurs continuously create new goods and services to satisfy
      those wants and needs, deploying unlimited numbers of people and machines in the process. this upward spiral has
      been running for hundreds of years, despite continuous howling from communists and luddites.<br />
      💎 indeed, as of 2019, before the temporary covid disruption, the result was the largest number of jobs at the
      highest wages and the highest levels of material living standards in the history of the planet.<br />
      💎 the techno-capital machine makes natural selection work for us in the realm of ideas.<br />
      💎 the best and most productive ideas win, and are combined and generate even better ideas. those ideas
      materialize in the real world as technologically enabled goods and services that never would have emerged de
      novo.<br />
      💎 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil" target="_blank">ray kurzweil</a> defines his law of
      accelerating returns:
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NoJnPmCVdU" target="_blank">technological advances</a> tend to feed on
      themselves, increasing the rate of further advance.<br />
      💎 we believe in accelerationism – the conscious and deliberate propulsion of technological development – to
      ensure the fulfillment of the law of accelerating returns. to ensure the techno-capital upward spiral continues
      forever.<br />
      💎 we believe the techno-capital machine is not anti-human – in fact, it may be the most pro-human thing there is.
      it serves us. the techno-capital machine works for us. all the machines work for us.<br />
      💎 we believe the cornerstone resources of the techno-capital upward spiral are intelligence and energy – ideas,
      and the power to make them real.<br />

    <h1 class="post-text" style="font-size: 1.8em"> VII. ENERGY </h1>
    <h5 class="post-text" style="text-align: left">
      ⭐️ energy is life. we take it for granted, but without it, we have darkness, starvation, and pain. with it, we
      have light, safety, and warmth.<br />
      ⭐️ we believe energy should be in an upward spiral. energy is the foundational engine of our civilization. the
      more energy we have, the more people we can have, and the better everyone's lives can be. we should raise everyone
      to the energy consumption level we have, then increase our energy 1,000x, then raise everyone else's energy 1,000x
      as well.<br />
      ⭐️ the current gap in per-capita energy use between the smaller developed world and larger developing world is
      enormous. that gap will close – either by massively expanding energy production, making everyone better off, or by
      massively reducing energy production, making everyone worse off.<br />
      ⭐️ we believe energy need not expand to the detriment of the natural environment. we have the silver bullet for
      virtually unlimited zero-emissions energy today – nuclear fission. in 1973, president richard nixon called for
      project independence, the construction of 1,000 nuclear power plants by the year 2000, to achieve complete US
      energy independence. nixon was right; we didn't build the plants then, but we can now, anytime we decide we want
      to.<br />
      ⭐️ atomic energy commissioner thomas murray said in 1953: "for years the splitting atom, packaged in weapons, has
      been our main shield against the barbarians. now, in addition, it is a
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79fzeNUqQbQ" target="_blank">G'd-given instrument</a> to do the
      constructive work of mankind". murray was right too.<br />
      ⭐️ we believe a second energy silver bullet is coming – nuclear fusion. we should build that as well. the same
      bad ideas that effectively outlawed fission are going to try to outlaw fusion. we should not let them.<br />
      ⭐️ we believe there is no inherent conflict between the techno-capital machine and the natural environment.
      per-capita US carbon emissions are lower now than they were 100 years ago, even without nuclear power.<br />
      ⭐️ we believe technology is the solution to environmental degradation and crisis. a technologically advanced
      society improves the natural environment, a technologically stagnant society ruins it. if you want to see
      environmental devastation, visit a former communist country. the socialist ussr was far worse for the natural
      environment than the capitalist US. google the aral sea.<br />
      ⭐️ we believe a technologically stagnant society has limited energy at the cost of environmental ruin; a
      technologically advanced society has unlimited clean energy for everyone.<br />

    <h1 class="post-text" style="font-size: 1.8em"> VIII. ABUNDANCE </h1>
    <h5 class="post-text" style="text-align: left">
      💜 we believe we should place intelligence and energy in a positive feedback loop, and drive them both to
      infinity.<br />
      💜 we believe we should use the feedback loop of intelligence and energy to make everything we want and need
      abundant.<br />
      💜 we believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy
      it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. if a lot of goods and services drop in
      price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life.<br />
      💜 we believe that if we make both intelligence and energy "too cheap to meter", the ultimate result will be that
      all physical goods become as cheap as pencils. pencils are actually quite technologically complex and difficult to
      manufacture, and yet nobody gets mad if you borrow a pencil and fail to return it. we should make the same true of
      all physical goods.<br />
      💜 we believe we should push to drop prices across the economy through the application of technology until as many
      prices are effectively zero as possible, driving income levels and quality of life into the stratosphere.<br />
      💜 we believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol" target="_blank">andy warhol</a> was right when
      he said,
      <i
        >"what's great about this country is america started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially
        the same things as the poorest. you can be watching tv and see coca-cola, and you can know that the president
        drinks coke, liz taylor drinks coke, and just think, you can drink coke, too. a coke is a coke and no amount of
        money can get you a better coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. all the cokes are the same and
        all the cokes are good"</i
      >. same for the browser, the smartphone, the chatbot.<br />
      💜 we believe that technology ultimately drives the world to what buckminster fuller called "ephemeralization" –
      what economists call "dematerialization". fuller: "<i
        >technology lets you do more and more with less and less until eventually you can do everything with nothing</i
      >".<br />
      💜 we believe technological progress therefore leads to material abundance for everyone.<br />
      💜 we believe the ultimate payoff from technological abundance can be a massive expansion in what
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Simon" target="_blank">julian simon</a> called "the ultimate
      resource" – people.<br />
      💜 we believe, as simon did, that people are the ultimate resource – with more people come more creativity, more
      new ideas, and more technological progress.<br />
      💜 we believe material abundance therefore ultimately means more people – a lot more people – which in turn leads
      to more abundance.<br />
      💜 we believe

        target="_blank"
        >our planet is dramatically underpopulated</a
      >, compared to the population we could have with abundant intelligence, energy, and material goods.<br />
      💜 we believe the global population can quite easily expand to 50 billion people or more, and then far beyond that
      as we ultimately settle other planets.<br />
      💜 we believe that out of all of these people will come scientists, technologists, artists, and visionaries beyond
      our wildest dreams.<br />
      💜 we believe
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj1QOz3iuCE" target="_blank">the ultimate mission of technology</a> is to
      advance life both on earth and in the stars. not utopia, but close enough. however, we are not utopians.<br />
      💜 we are adherents to what
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sowell" target="_blank">thomas sowell</a> calls the constrained
      vision. we believe the constrained vision – contra the unconstrained vision of utopia, communism, and expertise –
      means taking people as they are, testing ideas empirically, and liberating people to make their own choices.<br />
      💜 we believe in not utopia, but also not apocalypse.<br />
      💜 we believe change only happens on the margin – but a lot of change across a very large margin can lead to big
      outcomes.<br />
      💜 while not utopian, we believe in what brad delong terms "slouching toward utopia" – doing the best fallen
      humanity can do, making things better as we go.<br />

    <h5 class="post-text" style="text-align: left">
      🇺🇸 we believe that
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7uBP3Go3fk" target="_blank">advancing technology</a> is one of the most
      virtuous things that we can do.<br />
      🇺🇸 we believe in deliberately and systematically transforming ourselves into the kind of people
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0t6dmchpB4" target="_blank">who can advance technology</a>.<br />
      🇺🇸 we believe this certainly means
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3vDwPOx5PI" target="_blank">technical education</a>, but it also means
      going hands on, gaining practical skills, working within and leading teams – aspiring to build something greater
      than oneself, aspiring to work with others to build something greater as a group.<br />
      🇺🇸 we believe the natural human drive to make things, to gain territory, to explore the unknown can be channeled
      productively into building technology.<br />
      🇺🇸 we believe that while the physical frontier, at least here on earth, is closed, the technological frontier is
      wide open.<br />
      🇺🇸 we believe in exploring and claiming the technological frontier.<br />
      🇺🇸 we believe in the romance of technology, of industry. the eros of the train, the car, the electric light, the
      skyscraper. and the microchip, the neural network, the rocket, the split atom.<br />
      🇺🇸 we believe in adventure. undertaking the hero's journey, rebelling against the status quo, mapping uncharted
      territory, conquering dragons, and bringing home the spoils for our community.<br />
      🇺🇸 to paraphrase a manifesto of a different time and place: "<i
        ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itjEK77FAe4" target="_blank">beauty exists only in struggle</a>. there
        is no masterpiece that has not an aggressive character. technology must be a violent assault on the forces of
        the unknown, to force them to bow before man</i
      >".<br />
      🇺🇸 we believe that we are, have been, and will always be the masters of technology, not mastered by technology.
      victim mentality is a curse in every domain of life, including in our relationship with technology – both
      unnecessary and self-defeating. we are not victims, we are conquerors.<br />
      🇺🇸 we believe in nature, but we also believe in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polanyi%27s_paradox" target="_blank">overcoming nature</a>. we are not
      primitives, cowering in fear of the lightning bolt. we are the apex predator; the lightning works for us.<br />
      🇺🇸 we believe in greatness. we admire the great technologists and industrialists who came before us, and we aspire
      to make them proud of us today.<br />
      🇺🇸 and we believe in humanity – individually and collectively.<br />

      👹 our enemy is statism, authoritarianism, collectivism, central planning, socialism.<br />
      👹 our enemy is bureaucracy, vetocracy, gerontocracy, blind deference to tradition.<br />
      👹 our enemy is corruption, regulatory capture, monopolies, cartels.<br />
      👹 our enemy is institutions that in their youth were vital and energetic and truth-seeking, but are now
      compromised and corroded and collapsing – blocking progress in increasingly desperate bids for continued
      relevance, frantically trying to justify their ongoing funding despite spiraling dysfunction and escalating
      ineptness.<br />
      👹 our enemy is the ivory tower, the know-it-all credentialed expert worldview, indulging in abstract theories,
      luxury beliefs, social engineering, disconnected from the real world, delusional, unelected, and unaccountable –
      playing G'd with everyone else's lives, with total insulation from the consequences.<br />
      👹 our enemy is

      power, perhaps the most catastrophic mistake in western society in my lifetime. the precautionary principle
      continues to inflict enormous unnecessary suffering on our world today. it is deeply immoral, and we must jettison
      it with extreme prejudice.<br />

        the last man, who makes everything small. his species is ineradicable as the flea; the last man lives longest...
        one still works, for work is a pastime. but one is careful lest the pastime should hurt one. one no longer
        becomes poor or rich; both are too burdensome... no shepherd, and one herd! everyone wants the same; everyone is
        the same: he who feels differently goes voluntarily into the madhouse. "formerly all the world was insane" — say
        the subtlest of them, and they blink. they are clever and know all that has happened: so there is no end to
        their derision... "we have discovered happiness,” — say the last men, and they blink.</i

      (learned to read at ~4; to code at ~12; created my first business at ~13 - funny cute story - and used the $ to
      buy food because yes, we were poor)<br />
      i've always chased the next intellectual challenge because this is who i am (and these traits are very evident in
      my chart, which is very liberating).<br />
      i've often believed that the next person i fall in

      you also come to understand that you cannot (and you do not want to) change anyone - but your words can create
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNOu6tfmOOA" target="_blank">sparks</a> that will ignite renewing fires

          <br /><br />🦾 he's an outsider, just like myself — unafraid to be himself and challenge the status quo, and
          that's something i truly admire <br /><br />🦾 he keeps his word, and he's doing an outstanding job leading us
          toward unity and a

    <h1 class="post-text">edit of edit: why i forgive mr. tesla guy (previously aka monster)</h1>

    <h5 class="post-text" style="text-align: left; max-width: 70%; padding: 3em; margin: 2em auto">
      🚀 many of my current heroes and the folks i follow — and would love to learn from — are his friends. i have zero
      interest in changing their minds or making them feel bad.<br /><br />
      🚀 even though i once truly wanted to see him dead in the heat of my anger, i don't feel anything against him
      anymore. mr. president trump and i share the same motto:
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiEnCM08x0g" target="_blank">we don't believe in "forever enemies"</a>.
      if i am to stand for world peace, i need to make peace with my own enemies first.<br /><br />
      🚀 it was quite fun to scare him on several fronts during my red witch performance. i definitely won.<br /><br />
      🚀 i'm a founder, and i could probably learn a thing or two from him.<br /><br />
      🚀 i liked his white tie and appreciate all the efforts he's putting into helping president trump's administration
      fix the terrible state our beloved country was left in.<br /><br />
      🚀 i'd love to see an american flag 🇺🇸 on mars.<br /><br />
      🚀 i had a tesla when i was living in california (named
      <a href="imgs/my_tesla_named_summer.png" target="_blank">"summer"</a>) — damn, it was a fun car to drive.<br /><br />
      🚀 he's just a lil retard when it comes to women, but i kind of get it. plus the progessive woke retards made
      things really confusing when it comes to courting. plus, i've been around autistic men my whole life — physics,
      engineering, software, crypto, extreme sports, etc. — and he is not the first genius outlier who's become obsessed
      with me.<br /><br />
      🚀 we share a lot of common interests — in politics, philosophy, technology... — and neither of us are going to
      die soon, so yeah, we need to learn to get along.<br /><br />
      🚀 to be clear: vitalik and i have been (lightly) flirting for a while, and the cute stuff online was meant for
      him (and as we know, it turns out he is also a retard). in reality, before the hacking incident in november, i was
      just working hard and being myself online — with no romantic interests or hidden agendas (sorry to destroy your
      illusions, guys, but get real). i've been (gang-)stalked for many years (yeah, i am the hottest witch in town 🤷🏼‍♀️)
      and i don't know the extent of mr. tesla's involvement (and i don't want to know). i didn't know he was listening
      to my conversations, and i did not consent to anything he did. i still don't know exactly what happened, i have
      some good theories but, honestly, it doesn't matter anymore. i've been in the underworld for many years, and
      nothing shocks me anymore (i.e., "all's fair in love and war"). and comparing to all the amazing things i've done
      in my life and all the even more amazing things i'll be doing, this whole thing is nothing. plus, we are not the
      rebels anymore — we are the empire now.
      <br /><br />
      <span class="gradient-text"
        >⭐️ last thing, to make it absolutely obvious: mr. tesla guy, you caused a lot of trouble in my life, and i
        will never date you or have a child with you. whatever i post about space or science or anything is NOT meant
        for you - although you're allowed to be entertained by it if you want. you'll never conquer the core of saturn
        or uranus. but i am open to building a friendship based on mutual respect and winning. i'd also appreciate a
        public apology for your disrespectful behavior as a token of respect. and feel free to bend the knee when we
        meet in person, because i am a woman of grace. ⭐️ </span
      ><br /><br />
      <span class="gradient-text"
        >⭐️ ps: vitalik, i would also appreciate a public apology from you for all the trouble you caused me, and for
        the ridiculous situation you put me in over the past few weeks (or years? plus, you literally stole my idea for
        your ef post, wtf), and for all the times i could have sued your ass but didn't. let's start to treat the ladies
        fairly, shall we? ⭐️

      just as i will stand for my loyal love for G'd and for what lies beyond my small and ephemeral existence<br />

          the most powerful skill we possess as humans is our ability

          to alchemize pain and abuse into beauty and love
          <br />
          <br />

          life eases much more when you tune out the noise
          <br />
          and embrace your dreams with courage and kindness,
          <br />
          and yet, this is no trivial feat in a world so biased
          <br />
          toward the absurd - toward greed and egocentrism
          <br />
          <br />
          and now, i know exactly who i am,
          <br />
          what i will be building and creating,
          <br />
          who i will be loving in the years ahead

      i am excited about: quantum computing might be undergoing a groundbreaking shift with microsoft's recent

      in 1936, alan turing introduced the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine" target="_blank">universal turing machine</a>
      , a theoretical model of computation that could simulate any other turing machine.
      <br />
      in 1985, david deutsch extended this concept to quantum mechanics by proposing the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Turing_machine" target="_blank">quantum turing machine</a>,
      <br />
      a theoretical model capable of efficiently simulating quantum systems and laying the foundation for quantum
      computation.
      <br />
      remarkably, in 1994, peter shor demonstrated that
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm" target="_blank">
        quantum computers could efficiently factor large numbers</a

      <br />
      proving their superiority over classical computers and its implications for

        lot of progress has happened</a
      >
      in the field in the last decades,
      <br />
      however, one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing continues to be
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence" target="_blank">decoherence</a>,
      <br />
      (i.e., when quantum information is lost due to interactions with the environment).
      <br />
      unlike classical systems, where errors can often be mitigated through cooling,
      <br />
      quantum systems require error correction mechanisms due to their continuous nature.

      <br />
      <br />

      i explored various aspects of
      <a href="https://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/books/qi.pdf" target="_blank">
        quantum computing back during my phd</a
      >, but as a <a href="https://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch" target="_blank">string theorist</a>,
      <br />
      i was particularly drawn to the theoretical yet elegant approach of quantum
      <a href="https://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/books/tqfts.pdf" target="_blank">topological</a>
      computing,
      <br />
      which is
      <i>inherently fault-tolerant (i.e., resistant to decoherence)</i>. let's talk about it.

      <br />
      <br />

      starting from the basics, a quantum computer is a computational device that harnesses the principles of quantum
      mechanics
      <br />
      (such as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition" target="_blank">superposition</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" target="_blank">entanglement</a>, and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Bayesianism" target="_blank">quantum interference</a>) to process
      information in ways that classical computers cannot.
      <br />
      it does this by leveraging a primitive called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit" target="_blank">qubit</a>
      , a normalized linear superposition of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormality" target="_blank">orthonormal states</a>
      |0&gt; and |1&gt;,
      <br />
      which are members of the 2D complex vector space called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space" target="_blank">hilbert space</a>:

      <br />

      in a 3D space, particles can be classified as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson" target="_blank">bosons</a>
      (with integer spin quantum numbers) or
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion" target="_blank">fermions</a>
      (with half-integer spin quantum numbers).
      <br />
      when one particle in a 3D space is moved around another and returned to its original position,
      <br />
      this path is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism" target="_blank">topologically equivalent</a>
      to not moving the particle at all (because the path can be deformed into an arbitrarily small loop).
      <br />
      this constraint makes the statistics involved in exchanging fermions and bosons very simple, producing a phase
      change of π or 2π only.

      <br />
      <br />

      frank wilczek introduced the term
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon" target="_blank">anyon</a>
      in 1982, describing them as composites of charged particles in (2+1)-dimensional models.
      <br />
      the statistical properties of these quasiparticles are that they interpolate continuously between bosons and
      fermions,
      <br />
      i.e., they acquire arbitrary
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_factor" target="_blank">phase factors</a>
      when exchanged (and this phenomenon has been observed in the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_quantum_Hall_effect" target="_blank">
        fractional quantum hall effect</a
      >).

      <br />
      <br />

      in 2003, alexei kitaev published a radical idea in his
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9707021" target="_blank">
        "fault-tolerant quantum computation by anyons"</a
      >,
      <br />
      proposing that a 2D quantum system hosting
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-abelian_group" target="_blank">non-abelian</a>
      (i.e., non-commutative) anyonic excitations could function as a quantum computer.
      <br />
      in this model, computations are performed by braiding these anyons, inducing
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_transformation" target="_blank">unitary transformations</a>
      in the system's quantum state.

      <br />
      <br />

      one of the simplest models of non-abelian anyon is the
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3275" target="_blank">fibonacci anyon</a>,
      <br />
      which appears on the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern%E2%80%93Simons_theory" target="_blank">
        SU(2) witten–chern–simons topological quantum field theory</a
      >
      (yeap, that
      <a href="https://docs.urani.trade/mev-agents/operator-onboarding/solving-cryptomarkets/thank-you-jim">simons</a>).

      <br />
      <br />

      <div class="center-stuff">
        <img src="https://loyal.love/imgs/qc_qtf1.png" class="image-35" />
      </div>

      <br />
      <br />

      the fibonacci model contains two particle types:

      <br />
      <br />

      i) the vacuum (with 'charge' 0), denoted by 1, and
      <br />
      ii) the non-trivial anyon (with 'charge' 1) here denoted by 𝜏

      <br />
      <br />

      their fusion rules can be written as:

      <br />
      <br />

      <div class="center-stuff">
        1 ⊗ 𝜏 = 𝜏 (fusion with vacuum does nothing)
        <br />
        𝜏 ⊗ 1 = 𝜏 (fusion with vacuum does nothing)
        <br />
        𝜏 ⊗ 𝜏 = 1 ⊕ 𝜏 (creation of another anyon)
        <br />
        <br />
        (⊗ denotes the fusion of two particles and ⊕ denotes multiple possible outcomes)
      </div>
      <br />

      <div class="image-row">
        <img src="https://loyal.love/imgs/qc_braids.png" class="image-40" />
        <img src="https://loyal.love/imgs/qc_braids_2.png" class="image-40" />
        <img src="https://loyal.love/imgs/qc_qubits3.png" class="image-40" />
      </div>

      this means that when two fibonacci anyons interact, they can either fuse into vacuum (annihilating each other) or
      another fibonacci anyon.
      <br />
      if the braid was not present, then the two pairs would individually fuse to vacuum with 100% probability.
      <br />
      however, by performing the braiding and then fusing the particles, there is a non-zero probability that the fusion
      could give 1 instead of 0.
      <br />
      the net 'charge' of the whole system is still 0, though, so if the remaining two particles are fused, they must
      give the vacuum.
      <br />
      the outcome of the fusion of one of the pairs of anyons determines the fusion outcome of the other pair.
      <br />
      thus, their non-abelian nature ensures that exchanging them implements unitary transformations, forming the basis
      of topological quantum computation:

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <div class="center-stuff">
        1. create qubits from non-abelian anyons
        <br />
        2. move the anyons around — 'braiding' them to perform a computation
        <br />
        3. measure the state of the anyons by fusion
      </div>

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      for fibonacci anyons, the number of possible fusion outcomes (the dimension of the hilbert space)
      <br />
      grows according to the fibonacci sequence as more anyons are added.
      <br />
      this gives fibonacci anyons a quantum dimension of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio" target="_blank">golden ratio</a>.

      <br />
      <br />

      <div class="center-stuff">
        <img src="https://loyal.love/imgs/fib.png" class="image-25" />
      </div>

      <br />
      <br />

      in summary, fibonacci anyons naturally correct errors due to their topological properties:
      <br />
      a topologically ordered state with non-local quantum entanglement (i.e., small perturbations do not disrupt the
      system).
      <br />
      plus, the robustness of these systems allows for long-lasting quantum information storage.
