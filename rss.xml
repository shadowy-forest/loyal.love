2025, july, 4</title><description>the crypto anarchist manifesto , by timothy c. may, 1988 a specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy. computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. two persons may exchange messages , conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the true name, or legal identity, of the other. interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. these developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions , the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation. the technology for this revolution‚Äîand it surely will be both a social and economic revolution‚Äîhas existed in theory for the past decade. the methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. the focus has until now been on academic conferences in europe and the u.s., conferences monitored closely by the national security agency. but only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. and the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable . high-speed networks, isdn, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, ku-band transmitters, multi-mips personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies. the state will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology , citing national security concerns , use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. an anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of cryptonet. but this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy. just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. and just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier west, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property. arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="../imgs/geb_dragon.jpg" alt="Post image"/&gt;</description><link>https://loyal.love/chapters/25_summer.html#2025_july_04</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://loyal.love/chapters/25_summer.html#2025_july_04</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>waikiki;

2025, march, 22</title><description>happy equinox , anon as i chill under the sun and think about the adventures for spring, i want to talk about some science/engineering i am excited about: quantum computing might be undergoing a groundbreaking shift with microsoft's recent announcement of a chip hosting eight majorana-based topological qubits . although i won't take part in the discussion whether these results are hyped or not , i thought i could talk a little bit about the science behind topological quantum computers . in 1936, alan turing introduced the universal turing machine , a theoretical model of computation that could simulate any other turing machine. in 1985, david deutsch extended this concept to quantum mechanics by proposing the quantum turing machine , a theoretical model capable of efficiently simulating quantum systems and laying the foundation for quantum computation. remarkably, in 1994, peter shor demonstrated that quantum computers could efficiently factor large numbers , proving their superiority over classical computers and its implications for cryptography . lot of progress has happened in the field in the last decades, however, one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing continues to be decoherence , (i.e., when quantum information is lost due to interactions with the environment). unlike classical systems, where errors can often be mitigated through cooling, quantum systems require error correction mechanisms due to their continuous nature. i explored various aspects of quantum computing back during my phd , but as a string theorist , i was particularly drawn to the theoretical yet elegant approach of quantum topological computing, which is inherently fault-tolerant (i.e., resistant to decoherence) . let's talk about it. starting from the basics, a quantum computer is a computational device that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics (such as superposition , entanglement , and quantum interference ) to process information in ways that classical computers cannot. it does this by leveraging a primitive called qubit , a normalized linear superposition of the orthonormal states |0&gt; and |1&gt;, which are members of the 2D complex vector space called hilbert space : in a 3D space, particles can be classified as bosons (with integer spin quantum numbers) or fermions (with half-integer spin quantum numbers). when one particle in a 3D space is moved around another and returned to its original position, this path is topologically equivalent to not moving the particle at all (because the path can be deformed into an arbitrarily small loop). this constraint makes the statistics involved in exchanging fermions and bosons very simple, producing a phase change of œÄ or 2œÄ only. frank wilczek introduced the term anyon in 1982, describing them as composites of charged particles in (2+1)-dimensional models. the statistical properties of these quasiparticles are that they interpolate continuously between bosons and fermions, i.e., they acquire arbitrary phase factors when exchanged (and this phenomenon has been observed in the fractional quantum hall effect ). in 2003, alexei kitaev published a radical idea in his "fault-tolerant quantum computation by anyons" , proposing that a 2D quantum system hosting non-abelian (i.e., non-commutative) anyonic excitations could function as a quantum computer. in this model, computations are performed by braiding these anyons, inducing unitary transformations in the system's quantum state. one of the simplest models of non-abelian anyon is the fibonacci anyon , which appears on the SU(2) witten‚Äìchern‚Äìsimons topological quantum field theory (yeap, that simons ). the fibonacci model contains two particle types: i) the vacuum (with 'charge' 0), denoted by 1, and ii) the non-trivial anyon (with 'charge' 1) here denoted by ùúè their fusion rules can be written as: 1 ‚äó ùúè = ùúè (fusion with vacuum does nothing) ùúè ‚äó 1 = ùúè (fusion with vacuum does nothing) ùúè ‚äó ùúè = 1 ‚äï ùúè (creation of another anyon) (‚äó denotes the fusion of two particles and ‚äï denotes multiple possible outcomes) this means that when two fibonacci anyons interact, they can either fuse into vacuum (annihilating each other) or another fibonacci anyon. if the braid was not present, then the two pairs would individually fuse to vacuum with 100% probability. however, by performing the braiding and then fusing the particles, there is a non-zero probability that the fusion could give 1 instead of 0. the net 'charge' of the whole system is still 0, though, so if the remaining two particles are fused, they must give the vacuum. the outcome of the fusion of one of the pairs of anyons determines the fusion outcome of the other pair. thus, their non-abelian nature ensures that exchanging them implements unitary transformations, forming the basis of topological quantum computation: 1. create qubits from non-abelian anyons 2. move the anyons around ‚Äî 'braiding' them to perform a computation 3. measure the state of the anyons by fusion for fibonacci anyons, the number of possible fusion outcomes (the dimension of the hilbert space) grows according to the fibonacci sequence as more anyons are added. this gives fibonacci anyons a quantum dimension of the golden ratio . in summary, fibonacci anyons naturally correct errors due to their topological properties: a topologically ordered state with non-local quantum entanglement (i.e., small perturbations do not disrupt the system). plus, the robustness of these systems allows for long-lasting quantum information storage. if you are interested in learning more, i have some notes here (or specifically on fibonacci anyons here ). ah, and this paper on the study of the potts model, tutte, chromatic polynomials, and the connections with computation complexity and quantum computing is also a good read.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="../imgs/qc_qubits1.webp" alt="Post image"/&gt;</description><link>https://loyal.love/chapters/24_winter.html#2025_march_22</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://loyal.love/chapters/24_winter.html#2025_march_22</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>kreuzberg;
